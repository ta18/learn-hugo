In this section you learn to use the __Tensorflow Object Detection__ (_a.k.a_ TOD) API which offers:

* a collection of pre-trained networks, specially designed for object detection in images (__Object Detection__),
* a _transfer learning_ mechanism to continue the training of pre-trained networks with your own labeled images,
to obtain the detection of the objects of interest.

Unlike the __Classification__ strategy presented in the section [Classification](<https://learn.e.ros4.pro/en/vision/classification_tf2/>),
the __Object detection__ can directly find the bounding boxes of the targeted objects: it avoids the usage of conventional image processing to extract the sub-images of the targeted objets, then to classify the sub-images. The drawback of the image processing used to create the sub-images to be classified is that it involves some low level (pixel level) pre-processing of the image : thresholding, contour extraction, segmentation, etc... This processing is quite fragile: sensitive to brightness, to the presence or not of a black background ...

An expected advantage of the Object Detection approach is to provide the bounding boxes of the detected objects directly, without going through the image pre-processing step.

## Prerequisites

* Undergraduate or more.
* Know how to use basic Linux commands to work with and modify the file tree.
* Good understanding of Python and numpy arrays.
* A first experience of neural networks is desirable.

The training of neural networks with the `tensorflow` module will preferably be done within a __Python virtual environment__ (PVE) which allows one to work in a dedicated Python environment, separate from the existing one for working under ROS.

💻 Use the [Python3: virtual environment](<https://learn.e.ros4.pro/en/faq/python3/venv>) to create an PVE:

* named `tf2`,
* with a version of Python equal to `3.8`.

## Learning path

The course offered in this activity includes a prerequisite and 7 activities to be carried out successively:

Activités |  Description                                                            | Link | Approximate duration| 
:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----|:---------|
prerequisite| Create/initialize a Python Virtual Environment to work with the TOD API | [Python3: Virtual Environment](https://learn.e.ros4.pro/fr/faq/python3/venv/) | 40 min.<br>_depends on your internet transfert rate_
1| Install the _TensorFlow Oject Detection_ (_TOD_) API                      | [Install the TOD API](tod_install/) | 60 min.<br>_depending on your internet transfert rate and your CPU & RAM_ |
2| Create a multi-projects workspace                  | [Create your workspace](configure_working_tree) | 15 min.| 
3| Download a neural network pre-trained for object detection in images| [Download the pre-trained network](downlod_pre-trained_network/)| 20 min. <br>_depending on your internet transfert rate_|
4| Get images with the robot camera                   | [Get the images from the robot](get_images_from_robot/) | 30 min. |
5| Annotate images and create the training data files | [Annotate the images for supervised training](annotate_images)| 60 min. |
6| Continue the network training using your images    | [Re-train the network](re-train_network) | 1, 2 hours or more<br>depending on your CPU & RAM_|
7| Evaluate the re-trained network performance        | [Evaluate the network](evaluate_network) | 30 minutes<br>depending on your CPU & RAM_|

Once these steps are completed, _all that remains_ is to operate the re-trained neural network in the ROS environment ...
