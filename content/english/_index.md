# Robotics course and practical work

ROS4PRO is a set of resources for learning open-source robotics with the [ROS](http://ros.org) framework which will equip more than half of the robots sold in 2024. You can freely follow them, duplicate them and enrich them [share your improvements](https://github.com/ros4pro/learn-hugo).

## How to follow the practical work ?

ü§ñ It is likely that you will take this practical work as part of a course that provides you with robotic equipment. Depending on your equipment, several learning paths are available below. If you have no equipment, some paths can be partially followed in simulation.

üíª You must have a PC type computer as well as [Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) installed.

üìÄ To follow the learning paths without having to install ROS and the dependencies yourself, you can download [this Live USB stick](https://files.ros4.pro/ubuntu.img.7z) and [follow the instructions of flash](https://files.ros4.pro/boot.pdf).

## Learning paths

### Path #1 : Poppy Ergo Jr + tensorflow2 + Turtlebot (possible partially in simulation)
1. [Introduction](introduction/)
2. [Navigation](navigation/turtlebot/)
3. [Manipulation](manipulation/ergo-jr/)
4. [Vision](vision/)
5. [Int√©gration](integration/ergo-tb-keras/)

### Path #2 : Sawyer + tensorflow2 + Turtlebot
1. [Introduction](introduction/)
2. [Navigation](navigation/turtlebot/)
3. [Manipulation](manipulation/sawyer/)
4. [Vision](vision/)
5. [Int√©gration](integration/sawyer-tb-keras/)

## Legend
The following pictograms are used:

* üíª: Procedure to run on your Ubuntu workstation
* ü§ñ: Procedure to be performed on the robot, using SSH
* üìÄ: This procedure is already done for you if you launch Ubuntu via a Live USB key
* üêç: Python code to save and run on your workstation
* üì•: Resource to Download
* ‚úç: Answer questions in writing
